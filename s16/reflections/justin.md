# On CodeDay Bay Area Spring 2016
# May 21–22 at Galvanize San Francisco

A couple of assorted thoughts about this time around. Feel free to expand.

## Opening / Closing

I was on the ground floor most of the time during the opening and closing ceremonies, and it was pretty evident that no one was paying attention to the monitors. Although this could probably be attributed to the poor quality of the live stream—including the multiple audio echos and latency in the video—my thinking is that people inherently will not pay attention unless they are watching in person. One of the most worrying things about this trend is the first impression of many parents coming to pick up their children is a bunch of kids playing Pokémon and not really doing anything. Perhaps it would be useful to have someone at the registration desk at that time to tell parents to go downstairs.

## Food

If we continue to get Costco pizza, we should get combo pizza as well. It costs the same.

## Check In

Seemed to go much better this time as compared to the last couple of times in regard to line length despite the fact that Tejas and I didn’t get to finish up the nametag <> Clear integration in time. Paper tickets seemed wasteful since the only thing we needed them for was to check people in at the door. Perhaps ask people to pull up tickets on their phones instead of printing them out. Also, I understand that the waivers were more or less optional this time around, but the addition of the waivers seems to have confused many—parents and participants alike—since apparently many people did not receive emails asking them to fill out the waivers. Aside from that, many people didn’t fill them out because they seemed to have gotten confused by the volume of emails sent (e.g., confusion between the parent contact form and the waiver).

## Mentors

Not sure if this was mentioned during the opening ceremony or not, but it seemed as if a bunch of people were confused about the mentoring system.

## Venue

Overall, I thought that Galvanize was a nice change of pace from being cramped into Make School. That being said, Make School seemed pretty lax compared to Galvanize as to what we could and could not do. Also, I’m not sure if Galvanize would be worth it in the future if turnout and price remain as they were this time around.

## Pre-Event

Promotion could have been better. Given, spring is generally a bad time with regard to finals and end-of-year obligations, but I feel as if we could have made much more headway if we got everyone to start promoting early on. From talking with students, the discounts weren’t as good as before (5–10%) which might have discouraged some people from signing up immediately and instead waiting.
